INSTALL XTEXT FIRST!
http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/download.html

This repository contains 4 Eclipse projects:

	edu.iastate.cs.boa
	edu.iastate.cs.boa.sdk
	edu.iastate.cs.boa.tests
	edu.iastate.cs.boa.ui

Each project contains a 'src' sub-dir, which contains files you *can* modify and src-gen, xtend-gen sub-dirs that you should *not* modify (they are generated)!

Important files:
	edu.iastate.cs.boa/src/edu/iastate/cs/boa/Boa.xtext
	edu.iastate.cs.boa/src/edu/iastate/cs/boa/GenerateBoa.mwe2

If you modify the input grammar (Boa.xtext) or modeling engine workflow file (GenerateBoa.mwe2) you must rebuild!

Open the GenerateBoa.mwe2 file and Run As -> MWE2 Workflow.  This requires a lot of memory and time!

Once you have all files built, you can run the custom IDE:

	Right-click on edu.iastate.cs.boa project
	Run-As
	Eclipse Application

Note that anytime you make changes to source, you have to restart the custom IDE.
